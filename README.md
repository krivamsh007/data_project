## üìê Data Model & Test Data

### **Core Tables:**
- **Dim_Customer:**  
  - Attributes: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `location`, `customer_type`
- **Dim_Product:**  
  - Attributes: `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`, `supplier`, `cost_price`
- **Dim_Account:**  
  - Attributes: `account_id`, `account_type`, `balance`
- **Bridge_Customer_Account:**  
  - Attributes: `customer_id`, `account_id`, `relationship_type` (Primary/Secondary)
- **Fact_Transaction:**  
  - Attributes: `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `product_id`, `amount`, `timestamp`
- **Fact_Inventory:**  
  - Attributes: `stock_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `warehouse`
- **Fact_Customer_Behavior:**

## ü§ñ AI Use Cases & Reporting Requirements

### **AI Use Cases:**
1. **Demand Forecasting:** Predict future inventory needs.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Cluster customers for targeted marketing.
3. **Churn Prediction:** Identify at-risk customers based on transaction inactivity.
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Spot unusual transactions (fraud detection).
5. **Cross-Sell Opportunities:** Recommend additional products or services based on customer behavior.

### **Reporting Requirements (Examples):**
1. **Revenue Trends:** Daily, weekly, and monthly revenue with time-series analysis.
2. **Inventory Health:** Inventory levels, reorder points, and stockout alerts.
3. **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Spending patterns, segmentation reports, and churn rates.
4. **Product Performance:** Sales by product category, supplier analysis, and profit margins.
